## __Phases of the project__ ##
### 1. Data Exploration ###

<ul>

After analyzing the data I explored its columns, and the info it contains.

1. Understanding dataset size and structure.
2. The datatypes of the columns
3. Identifying key trends in content distribution.
4. Analyzing content categories, country contributions, and rating distributions.

</ul>

<hr>

### 2. Data Cleaning ###

<ul>

After exploring the data, checked it if there are any issues.

1. Handling missing values:
  
    * Missing ratings were replaced with "Unrated."
    * __date_added__ standardized to datetime format.

2. Removing duplicates and invalid data.

3. Adding computed columns:
